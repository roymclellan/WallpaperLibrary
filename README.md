## How to extract Images from your Windows 10 system
1. Create a new, temporary folder on your desktop.
2. Navigate to the following file path:
`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets`
3. Copy everything in this folder to the temporary folder you just created.
4. Open this temporary folder in a command prompt.
5. Type the following: `ren * *.jpg`.  This will add the .jpg extension to every file in your temporary folder.
6. Scroll through the images in your image viewer of choice, and save the wallpapers you like best.
